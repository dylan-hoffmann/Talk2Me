BARNARDO. says  Who’s there?

FRANCISCO. says  Nay, answer me. Stand and unfold yourself.

BARNARDO. says  Long live the King!

FRANCISCO. says  Barnardo?

BARNARDO. says  He.

FRANCISCO. says  You come most carefully upon your hour.

BARNARDO. says  ’Tis now struck twelve. Get thee to bed, Francisco.

FRANCISCO. says  For this relief much thanks. ’Tis bitter cold, And I am sick

BARNARDO. says  Have you had quiet guard?

FRANCISCO. says  Not a mouse stirring.

BARNARDO. says  Well, good night. If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus, The

FRANCISCO. says  I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who is there?

HORATIO. says  Friends to this ground.

MARCELLUS. says  And liegemen to the Dane.

FRANCISCO. says  Give you good night.

MARCELLUS. says  O, farewell, honest soldier, who hath reliev’d you?

FRANCISCO. says  Barnardo has my place. Give you good-night.

MARCELLUS. says  Holla, Barnardo!

BARNARDO. says  Say, what, is Horatio there?

HORATIO. says  A piece of him.

BARNARDO. says  Welcome, Horatio. Welcome, good Marcellus.

MARCELLUS. says  What, has this thing appear’d again tonight?

BARNARDO. says  I have seen nothing.

MARCELLUS. says  Horatio says ’tis but our fantasy, And will not let belief

HORATIO. says  Tush, tush, ’twill not appear.

BARNARDO. says  Sit down awhile, And let us once again assail your ears, That

HORATIO. says  Well, sit we down, And let us hear Barnardo speak of this.

BARNARDO. says  Last night of all, When yond same star that’s westward from

MARCELLUS. says  Peace, break thee off. Look where it comes again.

BARNARDO. says  In the same figure, like the King that’s dead.

MARCELLUS. says  Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.

BARNARDO. says  Looks it not like the King? Mark it, Horatio.

HORATIO. says  Most like. It harrows me with fear and wonder.

MARCELLUS. says  Question it, Horatio.

HORATIO. says  What art thou that usurp’st this time of night, Together with

MARCELLUS. says  It is offended.

BARNARDO. says  See, it stalks away.

HORATIO. says  Stay! speak, speak! I charge thee speak!

MARCELLUS. says  ’Tis gone, and will not answer.

BARNARDO. says  How now, Horatio! You tremble and look pale. Is not this

HORATIO. says  Before my God, I might not this believe Without the sensible

MARCELLUS. says  Is it not like the King?

HORATIO. says  As thou art to thyself: Such was the very armour he had on

MARCELLUS. says  Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour, With martial

HORATIO. says  In what particular thought to work I know not; But in the

MARCELLUS. says  Good now, sit down, and tell me, he that knows, Why this

HORATIO. says  That can I; At least, the whisper goes so. Our last King,

BARNARDO. says  I think it be no other but e’en so: Well may it sort that

HORATIO. says  A mote it is to trouble the mind’s eye. In the most high and

MARCELLUS. says  Shall I strike at it with my partisan?

HORATIO. says  Do, if it will not stand.

BARNARDO. says  ’Tis here!

HORATIO. says  ’Tis here!

MARCELLUS. says  ’Tis gone! We do it wrong, being so majestical, To offer it

BARNARDO. says  It was about to speak, when the cock crew.

HORATIO. says  And then it started, like a guilty thing Upon a fearful

MARCELLUS. says  It faded on the crowing of the cock. Some say that ever

HORATIO. says  So have I heard, and do in part believe it. But look, the morn

MARCELLUS. says  Let’s do’t, I pray, and I this morning know Where we shall

KING. says  Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother’s death The memory be

CORNELIUS and VOLTEMAND. says  In that, and all things, will we show our

KING. says  We doubt it nothing: heartily farewell.

LAERTES. says  Dread my lord, Your leave and favour to return to France, From

KING. says  Have you your father’s leave? What says Polonius?

POLONIUS. says  He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave By laboursome

KING. says  Take thy fair hour, Laertes; time be thine, And thy best graces

HAMLET. says  [_Aside._] A little more than kin, and less than kind.

KING. says  How is it that the clouds still hang on you?

HAMLET. says  Not so, my lord, I am too much i’ the sun.

QUEEN. says  Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off, And let thine eye look

HAMLET. says  Ay, madam, it is common.

QUEEN. says  If it be, Why seems it so particular with thee?

HAMLET. says  Seems, madam! Nay, it is; I know not seems. ’Tis not alone my

KING. says  ’Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet, To give these

QUEEN. says  Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet. I pray thee stay

HAMLET. says  I shall in all my best obey you, madam.

KING. says  Why, ’tis a loving and a fair reply. Be as ourself in Denmark.

HAMLET. says  O that this too too solid flesh would melt, Thaw, and resolve

HORATIO. says  Hail to your lordship!

HAMLET. says  I am glad to see you well: Horatio, or I do forget myself.

HORATIO. says  The same, my lord, And your poor servant ever.

HAMLET. says  Sir, my good friend; I’ll change that name with you: And what

MARCELLUS. says  My good lord.

HAMLET. says  I am very glad to see you.—Good even, sir.— But what, in faith,

HORATIO. says  A truant disposition, good my lord.

HAMLET. says  I would not hear your enemy say so; Nor shall you do my ear

HORATIO. says  My lord, I came to see your father’s funeral.

HAMLET. says  I prithee do not mock me, fellow-student. I think it was to see

HORATIO. says  Indeed, my lord, it follow’d hard upon.

HAMLET. says  Thrift, thrift, Horatio! The funeral bak’d meats Did coldly

HORATIO. says  Where, my lord?

HAMLET. says  In my mind’s eye, Horatio.

HORATIO. says  I saw him once; he was a goodly king.

HAMLET. says  He was a man, take him for all in all, I shall not look upon

HORATIO. says  My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.

HAMLET. says  Saw? Who?

HORATIO. says  My lord, the King your father.

HAMLET. says  The King my father!

HORATIO. says  Season your admiration for a while With an attent ear, till I

HAMLET. says  For God’s love let me hear.

HORATIO. says  Two nights together had these gentlemen, Marcellus and

HAMLET. says  But where was this?

MARCELLUS. says  My lord, upon the platform where we watch.

HAMLET. says  Did you not speak to it?

HORATIO. says  My lord, I did; But answer made it none: yet once methought It

HAMLET. says  ’Tis very strange.

HORATIO. says  As I do live, my honour’d lord, ’tis true; And we did think it

HAMLET. says  Indeed, indeed, sirs, but this troubles me. Hold you the watch

Mar. and BARNARDO. says  We do, my lord.

HAMLET. says  Arm’d, say you?

HAMLET. says  From top to toe?

HAMLET. says  Then saw you not his face?

HORATIO. says  O yes, my lord, he wore his beaver up.

HAMLET. says  What, look’d he frowningly?

HORATIO. says  A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.

HAMLET. says  Pale, or red?

HORATIO. says  Nay, very pale.

HAMLET. says  And fix’d his eyes upon you?

HORATIO. says  Most constantly.

HAMLET. says  I would I had been there.

HORATIO. says  It would have much amaz’d you.

HAMLET. says  Very like, very like. Stay’d it long?

HORATIO. says  While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.

MARCELLUS and BARNARDO. says  Longer, longer.

HORATIO. says  Not when I saw’t.

HAMLET. says  His beard was grizzled, no?

HORATIO. says  It was, as I have seen it in his life, A sable silver’d.

HAMLET. says  I will watch tonight; Perchance ’twill walk again.

HORATIO. says  I warrant you it will.

HAMLET. says  If it assume my noble father’s person, I’ll speak to it, though

HAMLET. says  Your loves, as mine to you: farewell.

LAERTES. says  My necessaries are embark’d. Farewell. And, sister, as the

OPHELIA. says  Do you doubt that?

LAERTES. says  For Hamlet, and the trifling of his favour, Hold it a fashion

OPHELIA. says  No more but so?

LAERTES. says  Think it no more. For nature crescent does not grow alone In

OPHELIA. says  I shall th’effect of this good lesson keep As watchman to my

LAERTES. says  O, fear me not. I stay too long. But here my father comes.

POLONIUS. says  Yet here, Laertes? Aboard, aboard, for shame. The wind sits

LAERTES. says  Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord.

POLONIUS. says  The time invites you; go, your servants tend.

LAERTES. says  Farewell, Ophelia, and remember well What I have said to you.

OPHELIA. says  ’Tis in my memory lock’d, And you yourself shall keep the key

LAERTES. says  Farewell.

POLONIUS. says  What is’t, Ophelia, he hath said to you?

OPHELIA. says  So please you, something touching the Lord Hamlet.

POLONIUS. says  Marry, well bethought: ’Tis told me he hath very oft of late

OPHELIA. says  He hath, my lord, of late made many tenders Of his affection

POLONIUS. says  Affection! Pooh! You speak like a green girl, Unsifted in

OPHELIA. says  I do not know, my lord, what I should think.

POLONIUS. says  Marry, I’ll teach you; think yourself a baby; That you have

OPHELIA. says  My lord, he hath importun’d me with love In honourable

POLONIUS. says  Ay, fashion you may call it; go to, go to.

OPHELIA. says  And hath given countenance to his speech, my lord, With almost

POLONIUS. says  Ay, springes to catch woodcocks. I do know, When the blood

OPHELIA. says  I shall obey, my lord.

HAMLET. says  The air bites shrewdly; it is very cold.

HORATIO. says  It is a nipping and an eager air.

HAMLET. says  What hour now?

HORATIO. says  I think it lacks of twelve.

MARCELLUS. says  No, it is struck.

HORATIO. says  Indeed? I heard it not. It then draws near the season Wherein

HAMLET. says  The King doth wake tonight and takes his rouse, Keeps wassail,

HORATIO. says  Is it a custom?

HAMLET. says  Ay marry is’t; And to my mind, though I am native here, And to

HORATIO. says  Look, my lord, it comes!

HAMLET. says  Angels and ministers of grace defend us! Be thou a spirit of

HORATIO. says  It beckons you to go away with it, As if it some impartment

MARCELLUS. says  Look with what courteous action It waves you to a more

HORATIO. says  No, by no means.

HAMLET. says  It will not speak; then will I follow it.

HORATIO. says  Do not, my lord.

HAMLET. says  Why, what should be the fear? I do not set my life at a pin’s

HORATIO. says  What if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord, Or to the

HAMLET. says  It waves me still. Go on, I’ll follow thee.

MARCELLUS. says  You shall not go, my lord.

HAMLET. says  Hold off your hands.

HORATIO. says  Be rul’d; you shall not go.

HAMLET. says  My fate cries out, And makes each petty artery in this body As

HORATIO. says  He waxes desperate with imagination.

MARCELLUS. says  Let’s follow; ’tis not fit thus to obey him.

HORATIO. says  Have after. To what issue will this come?

MARCELLUS. says  Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.

HORATIO. says  Heaven will direct it.

MARCELLUS. says  Nay, let’s follow him.

HAMLET. says  Whither wilt thou lead me? Speak, I’ll go no further.

GHOST. says  Mark me.

HAMLET. says  I will.

GHOST. says  My hour is almost come, When I to sulph’rous and tormenting

HAMLET. says  Alas, poor ghost!

GHOST. says  Pity me not, but lend thy serious hearing To what I shall

HAMLET. says  Speak, I am bound to hear.

GHOST. says  So art thou to revenge, when thou shalt hear.

HAMLET. says  What?

GHOST. says  I am thy father’s spirit, Doom’d for a certain term to walk the

HAMLET. says  O God!

GHOST. says  Revenge his foul and most unnatural murder.

HAMLET. says  Murder!

GHOST. says  Murder most foul, as in the best it is; But this most foul,

HAMLET. says  Haste me to know’t, that I, with wings as swift As meditation

GHOST. says  I find thee apt; And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed

HAMLET. says  O my prophetic soul! Mine uncle!

GHOST. says  Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast, With witchcraft of

HAMLET. says  O all you host of heaven! O earth! What else? And shall I

HORATIO and MARCELLUS. says  [_Within._] My lord, my lord.

MARCELLUS. says  [_Within._] Lord Hamlet.

HORATIO. says  [_Within._] Heaven secure him.

HAMLET. says  So be it!

MARCELLUS. says  [_Within._] Illo, ho, ho, my lord!

HAMLET. says  Hillo, ho, ho, boy! Come, bird, come.

MARCELLUS. says  How is’t, my noble lord?

HORATIO. says  What news, my lord?

HAMLET. says  O, wonderful!

HORATIO. says  Good my lord, tell it.

HAMLET. says  No, you’ll reveal it.

HORATIO. says  Not I, my lord, by heaven.

MARCELLUS. says  Nor I, my lord.

HAMLET. says  How say you then, would heart of man once think it?— But you’ll

HORATIO and MARCELLUS. says  Ay, by heaven, my lord.

HAMLET. says  There’s ne’er a villain dwelling in all Denmark But he’s an

HORATIO. says  There needs no ghost, my lord, come from the grave To tell us

HAMLET. says  Why, right; you are i’ the right; And so, without more

HORATIO. says  These are but wild and whirling words, my lord.

HAMLET. says  I’m sorry they offend you, heartily; Yes faith, heartily.

HORATIO. says  There’s no offence, my lord.

HAMLET. says  Yes, by Saint Patrick, but there is, Horatio, And much offence

HORATIO. says  What is’t, my lord? We will.

HAMLET. says  Never make known what you have seen tonight.

HORATIO and MARCELLUS. says  My lord, we will not.

HAMLET. says  Nay, but swear’t.

HORATIO. says  In faith, my lord, not I.

MARCELLUS. says  Nor I, my lord, in faith.

HAMLET. says  Upon my sword.

MARCELLUS. says  We have sworn, my lord, already.

HAMLET. says  Indeed, upon my sword, indeed.

GHOST. says  [_Cries under the stage._] Swear.

HAMLET. says  Ha, ha boy, say’st thou so? Art thou there, truepenny? Come on,

HORATIO. says  Propose the oath, my lord.

HAMLET. says  Never to speak of this that you have seen. Swear by my sword.

GHOST. says  [_Beneath._] Swear.

HAMLET. says  _Hic et ubique?_ Then we’ll shift our ground. Come hither,

GHOST. says  [_Beneath._] Swear.

HAMLET. says  Well said, old mole! Canst work i’ th’earth so fast? A worthy

HORATIO. says  O day and night, but this is wondrous strange.

HAMLET. says  And therefore as a stranger give it welcome. There are more

GHOST. says  [_Beneath._] Swear.

HAMLET. says  Rest, rest, perturbed spirit. So, gentlemen, With all my love I

POLONIUS. says  Give him this money and these notes, Reynaldo.

REYNALDO. says  I will, my lord.

POLONIUS. says  You shall do marvellous wisely, good Reynaldo, Before you

REYNALDO. says  My lord, I did intend it.

POLONIUS. says  Marry, well said; very well said. Look you, sir, Enquire me

REYNALDO. says  Ay, very well, my lord.

POLONIUS. says  ‘And in part him, but,’ you may say, ‘not well; But if’t be

REYNALDO. says  As gaming, my lord?

POLONIUS. says  Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing, Quarrelling, drabbing.

REYNALDO. says  My lord, that would dishonour him.

POLONIUS. says  Faith no, as you may season it in the charge. You must not

REYNALDO. says  But my good lord—

POLONIUS. says  Wherefore should you do this?

REYNALDO. says  Ay, my lord, I would know that.

POLONIUS. says  Marry, sir, here’s my drift, And I believe it is a fetch of

REYNALDO. says  Very good, my lord.

POLONIUS. says  And then, sir, does he this,— He does—What was I about to

REYNALDO. says  At ‘closes in the consequence.’ At ‘friend or so,’ and

POLONIUS. says  At ‘closes in the consequence’ ay, marry! He closes with you

REYNALDO. says  My lord, I have.

POLONIUS. says  God b’ wi’ you, fare you well.

REYNALDO. says  Good my lord.

POLONIUS. says  Observe his inclination in yourself.

REYNALDO. says  I shall, my lord.

POLONIUS. says  And let him ply his music.

REYNALDO. says  Well, my lord.

POLONIUS. says  Farewell.

OPHELIA. says  Alas, my lord, I have been so affrighted.

POLONIUS. says  With what, in the name of God?

OPHELIA. says  My lord, as I was sewing in my chamber, Lord Hamlet, with his

POLONIUS. says  Mad for thy love?

OPHELIA. says  My lord, I do not know, but truly I do fear it.

POLONIUS. says  What said he?

OPHELIA. says  He took me by the wrist and held me hard; Then goes he to the

POLONIUS. says  Come, go with me. I will go seek the King. This is the very

OPHELIA. says  No, my good lord; but as you did command, I did repel his

POLONIUS. says  That hath made him mad. I am sorry that with better heed and

KING. says  Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. Moreover that we much

QUEEN. says  Good gentlemen, he hath much talk’d of you, And sure I am, two

ROSENCRANTZ. says  Both your majesties Might, by the sovereign power you have

GUILDENSTERN. says  We both obey, And here give up ourselves, in the full

KING. says  Thanks, Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern.

QUEEN. says  Thanks, Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz. And I beseech you

GUILDENSTERN. says  Heavens make our presence and our practices Pleasant and

QUEEN. says  Ay, amen.

POLONIUS. says  Th’ambassadors from Norway, my good lord, Are joyfully

KING. says  Thou still hast been the father of good news.

POLONIUS. says  Have I, my lord? Assure you, my good liege, I hold my duty,

KING. says  O speak of that, that do I long to hear.

POLONIUS. says  Give first admittance to th’ambassadors; My news shall be the

KING. says  Thyself do grace to them, and bring them in.

QUEEN. says  I doubt it is no other but the main, His father’s death and our

KING. says  Well, we shall sift him.

VOLTEMAND. says  Most fair return of greetings and desires. Upon our first,

KING. says  It likes us well; And at our more consider’d time we’ll read,

POLONIUS. says  This business is well ended. My liege and madam, to

QUEEN. says  More matter, with less art.

POLONIUS. says  Madam, I swear I use no art at all. That he is mad, ’tis

QUEEN. says  Came this from Hamlet to her?

POLONIUS. says  Good madam, stay awhile; I will be faithful. [_Reads._]

whilst this machine is to him, HAMLET. says _ This in obedience hath my

KING. says  But how hath she receiv’d his love?

POLONIUS. says  What do you think of me?

KING. says  As of a man faithful and honourable.

POLONIUS. says  I would fain prove so. But what might you think, When I had

KING. says  Do you think ’tis this?

QUEEN. says  It may be, very likely.

POLONIUS. says  Hath there been such a time, I’d fain know that, That I have

KING. says  Not that I know.

POLONIUS. says  Take this from this, if this be otherwise. [_Points to his

KING. says  How may we try it further?

POLONIUS. says  You know sometimes he walks four hours together Here in the

QUEEN. says  So he does indeed.

POLONIUS. says  At such a time I’ll loose my daughter to him. Be you and I

KING. says  We will try it.

QUEEN. says  But look where sadly the poor wretch comes reading.

POLONIUS. says  Away, I do beseech you, both away I’ll board him presently.

HAMLET. says  Well, God-a-mercy.

POLONIUS. says  Do you know me, my lord?

HAMLET. says  Excellent well. You’re a fishmonger.

POLONIUS. says  Not I, my lord.

HAMLET. says  Then I would you were so honest a man.

POLONIUS. says  Honest, my lord?

HAMLET. says  Ay sir, to be honest, as this world goes, is to be one man

POLONIUS. says  That’s very true, my lord.

HAMLET. says  For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog, being a good

POLONIUS. says  I have, my lord.

HAMLET. says  Let her not walk i’ th’ sun. Conception is a blessing, but not

POLONIUS. says  How say you by that? [_Aside._] Still harping on my daughter.

HAMLET. says  Words, words, words.

POLONIUS. says  What is the matter, my lord?

HAMLET. says  Between who?

POLONIUS. says  I mean the matter that you read, my lord.

HAMLET. says  Slanders, sir. For the satirical slave says here that old men

POLONIUS. says  [_Aside._] Though this be madness, yet there is a method

HAMLET. says  Into my grave?

POLONIUS. says  Indeed, that is out o’ the air. [_Aside._] How pregnant

HAMLET. says  You cannot, sir, take from me anything that I will more

POLONIUS. says  Fare you well, my lord.

HAMLET. says  These tedious old fools.

POLONIUS. says  You go to seek the Lord Hamlet; there he is.

ROSENCRANTZ. says  [_To Polonius._] God save you, sir.

GUILDENSTERN. says  My honoured lord!

ROSENCRANTZ. says  My most dear lord!

HAMLET. says  My excellent good friends! How dost thou, Guildenstern? Ah,

ROSENCRANTZ. says  As the indifferent children of the earth.

GUILDENSTERN. says  Happy in that we are not over-happy; On Fortune’s cap we

HAMLET. says  Nor the soles of her shoe?

ROSENCRANTZ. says  Neither, my lord.

HAMLET. says  Then you live about her waist, or in the middle of her favours?

GUILDENSTERN. says  Faith, her privates we.

HAMLET. says  In the secret parts of Fortune? O, most true; she is a

ROSENCRANTZ. says  None, my lord, but that the world’s grown honest.

HAMLET. says  Then is doomsday near. But your news is not true. Let me

GUILDENSTERN. says  Prison, my lord?

HAMLET. says  Denmark’s a prison.

ROSENCRANTZ. says  Then is the world one.

HAMLET. says  A goodly one; in which there are many confines, wards, and

ROSENCRANTZ. says  We think not so, my lord.

HAMLET. says  Why, then ’tis none to you; for there is nothing either good or

ROSENCRANTZ. says  Why, then your ambition makes it one; ’tis too narrow for

HAMLET. says  O God, I could be bounded in a nutshell, and count myself a

GUILDENSTERN. says  Which dreams, indeed, are ambition; for the very

HAMLET. says  A dream itself is but a shadow.

ROSENCRANTZ. says  Truly, and I hold ambition of so airy and light a quality

HAMLET. says  Then are our beggars bodies, and our monarchs and outstretch’d

ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN. says  We’ll wait upon you.

HAMLET. says  No such matter. I will not sort you with the rest of my

ROSENCRANTZ. says  To visit you, my lord, no other occasion.

HAMLET. says  Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks; but I thank you.

GUILDENSTERN. says  What should we say, my lord?

HAMLET. says  Why, anything. But to the purpose. You were sent for; and there

ROSENCRANTZ. says  To what end, my lord?

HAMLET. says  That you must teach me. But let me conjure you, by the rights

ROSENCRANTZ. says  [_To Guildenstern._] What say you?

HAMLET. says  [_Aside._] Nay, then I have an eye of you. If you love me, hold

GUILDENSTERN. says  My lord, we were sent for.

HAMLET. says  I will tell you why; so shall my anticipation prevent your

ROSENCRANTZ. says  My lord, there was no such stuff in my thoughts.

HAMLET. says  Why did you laugh then, when I said ‘Man delights not me’?

ROSENCRANTZ. says  To think, my lord, if you delight not in man, what Lenten

HAMLET. says  He that plays the king shall be welcome,—his Majesty shall have

ROSENCRANTZ. says  Even those you were wont to take such delight in—the

HAMLET. says  How chances it they travel? Their residence, both in reputation

ROSENCRANTZ. says  I think their inhibition comes by the means of the late

HAMLET. says  Do they hold the same estimation they did when I was in the

ROSENCRANTZ. says  No, indeed, they are not.

HAMLET. says  How comes it? Do they grow rusty?

ROSENCRANTZ. says  Nay, their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace; but there

HAMLET. says  What, are they children? Who maintains ’em? How are they

ROSENCRANTZ. says  Faith, there has been much to do on both sides; and the

HAMLET. says  Is’t possible?

GUILDENSTERN. says  O, there has been much throwing about of brains.

HAMLET. says  Do the boys carry it away?

ROSENCRANTZ. says  Ay, that they do, my lord. Hercules and his load too.

HAMLET. says  It is not very strange; for my uncle is King of Denmark, and

GUILDENSTERN. says  There are the players.

HAMLET. says  Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore. Your hands, come. The

GUILDENSTERN. says  In what, my dear lord?

HAMLET. says  I am but mad north-north-west. When the wind is southerly, I

POLONIUS. says  Well be with you, gentlemen.

HAMLET. says  Hark you, Guildenstern, and you too, at each ear a hearer. That

ROSENCRANTZ. says  Happily he’s the second time come to them; for they say an

HAMLET. says  I will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players. Mark

POLONIUS. says  My lord, I have news to tell you.

HAMLET. says  My lord, I have news to tell you. When Roscius was an actor in

POLONIUS. says  The actors are come hither, my lord.

HAMLET. says  Buzz, buzz.

POLONIUS. says  Upon my honour.

HAMLET. says  Then came each actor on his ass—

POLONIUS. says  The best actors in the world, either for tragedy, comedy,

HAMLET. says  O Jephthah, judge of Israel, what a treasure hadst thou!

POLONIUS. says  What treasure had he, my lord?

HAMLET. says  Why— ’One fair daughter, and no more, The which he loved

POLONIUS. says  [_Aside._] Still on my daughter.

HAMLET. says  Am I not i’ th’ right, old Jephthah?

POLONIUS. says  If you call me Jephthah, my lord, I have a daughter that I

HAMLET. says  Nay, that follows not.

POLONIUS. says  What follows then, my lord?

HAMLET. says  Why, As by lot, God wot, and then, you know, It came to pass,

HAMLET. says  I heard thee speak me a speech once, but it was never acted, or

POLONIUS. says  ’Fore God, my lord, well spoken, with good accent and good

POLONIUS. says  This is too long.

HAMLET. says  It shall to the barber’s, with your beard.—Prythee say on. He’s

HAMLET. says  ‘The mobled queen’?

POLONIUS. says  That’s good! ‘Mobled queen’ is good.

POLONIUS. says  Look, where he has not turn’d his colour, and has tears in’s

HAMLET. says  ’Tis well. I’ll have thee speak out the rest of this soon.—Good

POLONIUS. says  My lord, I will use them according to their desert.

HAMLET. says  God’s bodikin, man, better. Use every man after his desert, and

POLONIUS. says  Come, sirs.

HAMLET. says  Follow him, friends. We’ll hear a play tomorrow.

HAMLET. says  We’ll ha’t tomorrow night. You could for a need study a speech

HAMLET. says  Very well. Follow that lord, and look you mock him not.

ROSENCRANTZ. says  Good my lord.

HAMLET. says  Ay, so, God b’ wi’ ye. Now I am alone. O what a rogue and

KING. says  And can you by no drift of circumstance Get from him why he puts

ROSENCRANTZ. says  He does confess he feels himself distracted, But from what

GUILDENSTERN. says  Nor do we find him forward to be sounded, But with a

QUEEN. says  Did he receive you well?

ROSENCRANTZ. says  Most like a gentleman.

GUILDENSTERN. says  But with much forcing of his disposition.

ROSENCRANTZ. says  Niggard of question, but of our demands, Most free in his

QUEEN. says  Did you assay him to any pastime?

ROSENCRANTZ. says  Madam, it so fell out that certain players We o’er-raught

POLONIUS. says  ’Tis most true; And he beseech’d me to entreat your Majesties

KING. says  With all my heart; and it doth much content me To hear him so

ROSENCRANTZ. says  We shall, my lord.

KING. says  Sweet Gertrude, leave us too, For we have closely sent for Hamlet

QUEEN. says  I shall obey you. And for your part, Ophelia, I do wish That

OPHELIA. says  Madam, I wish it may.

POLONIUS. says  Ophelia, walk you here.—Gracious, so please you, We will

KING. says  [_Aside._] O ’tis too true! How smart a lash that speech doth

POLONIUS. says  I hear him coming. Let’s withdraw, my lord.

HAMLET. says  To be, or not to be, that is the question: Whether ’tis nobler

OPHELIA. says  Good my lord, How does your honour for this many a day?

HAMLET. says  I humbly thank you; well, well, well.

OPHELIA. says  My lord, I have remembrances of yours That I have longed long

HAMLET. says  No, not I. I never gave you aught.

OPHELIA. says  My honour’d lord, you know right well you did, And with them

HAMLET. says  Ha, ha! Are you honest?

OPHELIA. says  My lord?

HAMLET. says  Are you fair?

OPHELIA. says  What means your lordship?

HAMLET. says  That if you be honest and fair, your honesty should admit no

OPHELIA. says  Could beauty, my lord, have better commerce than with honesty?

HAMLET. says  Ay, truly; for the power of beauty will sooner transform

OPHELIA. says  Indeed, my lord, you made me believe so.

HAMLET. says  You should not have believed me; for virtue cannot so inoculate

OPHELIA. says  I was the more deceived.

HAMLET. says  Get thee to a nunnery. Why wouldst thou be a breeder of

OPHELIA. says  At home, my lord.

HAMLET. says  Let the doors be shut upon him, that he may play the fool

OPHELIA. says  O help him, you sweet heavens!

HAMLET. says  If thou dost marry, I’ll give thee this plague for thy dowry.

OPHELIA. says  O heavenly powers, restore him!

HAMLET. says  I have heard of your paintings too, well enough. God hath given

OPHELIA. says  O, what a noble mind is here o’erthrown! The courtier’s,

KING. says  Love? His affections do not that way tend, Nor what he spake,

POLONIUS. says  It shall do well. But yet do I believe The origin and

KING. says  It shall be so. Madness in great ones must not unwatch’d go.

HAMLET. says  Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced it to you,

HAMLET. says  Be not too tame neither; but let your own discretion be your

HAMLET. says  O reform it altogether. And let those that play your clowns

POLONIUS. says  And the Queen too, and that presently.

HAMLET. says  Bid the players make haste.

ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN. says  We will, my lord.

HAMLET. says  What ho, Horatio!

HORATIO. says  Here, sweet lord, at your service.

HAMLET. says  Horatio, thou art e’en as just a man As e’er my conversation

HORATIO. says  O my dear lord.

HAMLET. says  Nay, do not think I flatter; For what advancement may I hope

HORATIO. says  Well, my lord. If he steal aught the whilst this play is

HAMLET. says  They are coming to the play. I must be idle. Get you a place.

KING. says  How fares our cousin Hamlet?

HAMLET. says  Excellent, i’ faith; of the chameleon’s dish: I eat the air,

KING. says  I have nothing with this answer, Hamlet; these words are not

HAMLET. says  No, nor mine now. [_To Polonius._] My lord, you play’d once i’

POLONIUS. says  That did I, my lord, and was accounted a good actor.

HAMLET. says  What did you enact?

POLONIUS. says  I did enact Julius Caesar. I was kill’d i’ th’ Capitol.

HAMLET. says  It was a brute part of him to kill so capital a calf there. Be

ROSENCRANTZ. says  Ay, my lord; they stay upon your patience.

QUEEN. says  Come hither, my dear Hamlet, sit by me.

HAMLET. says  No, good mother, here’s metal more attractive.

POLONIUS. says  [_To the King._] O ho! do you mark that?

HAMLET. says  Lady, shall I lie in your lap?

OPHELIA. says  No, my lord.

HAMLET. says  I mean, my head upon your lap?

OPHELIA. says  Ay, my lord.

HAMLET. says  Do you think I meant country matters?

OPHELIA. says  I think nothing, my lord.

HAMLET. says  That’s a fair thought to lie between maids’ legs.

OPHELIA. says  What is, my lord?

HAMLET. says  Nothing.

OPHELIA. says  You are merry, my lord.

HAMLET. says  Who, I?

OPHELIA. says  Ay, my lord.

HAMLET. says  O God, your only jig-maker! What should a man do but be merry?

OPHELIA. says  Nay, ’tis twice two months, my lord.

HAMLET. says  So long? Nay then, let the devil wear black, for I’ll have a

OPHELIA. says  What means this, my lord?

HAMLET. says  Marry, this is miching mallicho; it means mischief.

OPHELIA. says  Belike this show imports the argument of the play.

HAMLET. says  We shall know by this fellow: the players cannot keep counsel;

OPHELIA. says  Will they tell us what this show meant?

HAMLET. says  Ay, or any show that you’ll show him. Be not you ashamed to

OPHELIA. says  You are naught, you are naught: I’ll mark the play.

HAMLET. says  Is this a prologue, or the posy of a ring?

OPHELIA. says  ’Tis brief, my lord.

HAMLET. says  As woman’s love.

PLAYER KING. says  Full thirty times hath Phoebus’ cart gone round Neptune’s

PLAYER QUEEN. says  So many journeys may the sun and moon Make us again count

PLAYER KING. says  Faith, I must leave thee, love, and shortly too: My

PLAYER QUEEN. says  O confound the rest. Such love must needs be treason in

PLAYER KING. says  ’Tis deeply sworn. Sweet, leave me here awhile. My spirits

PLAYER QUEEN. says  Sleep rock thy brain, And never come mischance between us

HAMLET. says  Madam, how like you this play?

QUEEN. says  The lady protests too much, methinks.

HAMLET. says  O, but she’ll keep her word.

KING. says  Have you heard the argument? Is there no offence in’t?

HAMLET. says  No, no, they do but jest, poison in jest; no offence i’ th’

KING. says  What do you call the play?

HAMLET. says  _The Mousetrap._ Marry, how? Tropically. This play is the image

OPHELIA. says  You are a good chorus, my lord.

HAMLET. says  I could interpret between you and your love, if I could see the

OPHELIA. says  You are keen, my lord, you are keen.

HAMLET. says  It would cost you a groaning to take off my edge.

OPHELIA. says  Still better, and worse.

OPHELIA. says  The King rises.

HAMLET. says  What, frighted with false fire?

QUEEN. says  How fares my lord?

POLONIUS. says  Give o’er the play.

KING. says  Give me some light. Away.

HAMLET. says  Why, let the strucken deer go weep, The hart ungalled play; For

HORATIO. says  Half a share.

HAMLET. says  A whole one, I. For thou dost know, O Damon dear, This realm

HORATIO. says  You might have rhymed.

HAMLET. says  O good Horatio, I’ll take the ghost’s word for a thousand

HORATIO. says  Very well, my lord.

HAMLET. says  Upon the talk of the poisoning?

HORATIO. says  I did very well note him.

HAMLET. says  Ah, ha! Come, some music. Come, the recorders. For if the king

GUILDENSTERN. says  Good my lord, vouchsafe me a word with you.

HAMLET. says  Sir, a whole history.

GUILDENSTERN. says  The King, sir—

HAMLET. says  Ay, sir, what of him?

GUILDENSTERN. says  Is in his retirement, marvellous distempered.

HAMLET. says  With drink, sir?

GUILDENSTERN. says  No, my lord; rather with choler.

HAMLET. says  Your wisdom should show itself more richer to signify this to

GUILDENSTERN. says  Good my lord, put your discourse into some frame, and

HAMLET. says  I am tame, sir, pronounce.

GUILDENSTERN. says  The Queen your mother, in most great affliction of

GUILDENSTERN. says  Nay, good my lord, this courtesy is not of the right

HAMLET. says  Sir, I cannot.

GUILDENSTERN. says  What, my lord?

HAMLET. says  Make you a wholesome answer. My wit’s diseased. But, sir, such

ROSENCRANTZ. says  She desires to speak with you in her closet ere you go to

HAMLET. says  We shall obey, were she ten times our mother. Have you any

ROSENCRANTZ. says  My lord, you once did love me.

HAMLET. says  And so I do still, by these pickers and stealers.

ROSENCRANTZ. says  Good my lord, what is your cause of distemper? You do

HAMLET. says  Sir, I lack advancement.

ROSENCRANTZ. says  How can that be, when you have the voice of the King

HAMLET. says  Ay, sir, but while the grass grows—the proverb is something

GUILDENSTERN. says  O my lord, if my duty be too bold, my love is too

HAMLET. says  I do not well understand that. Will you play upon this pipe?

GUILDENSTERN. says  My lord, I cannot.

HAMLET. says  I pray you.

GUILDENSTERN. says  Believe me, I cannot.

HAMLET. says  I do beseech you.

GUILDENSTERN. says  I know no touch of it, my lord.

HAMLET. says  ’Tis as easy as lying: govern these ventages with your finger

GUILDENSTERN. says  But these cannot I command to any utterance of harmony. I

HAMLET. says  Why, look you now, how unworthy a thing you make of me! You

POLONIUS. says  My lord, the Queen would speak with you, and presently.

HAMLET. says  Do you see yonder cloud that’s almost in shape of a camel?

POLONIUS. says  By the mass, and ’tis like a camel indeed.

HAMLET. says  Methinks it is like a weasel.

POLONIUS. says  It is backed like a weasel.

HAMLET. says  Or like a whale.

POLONIUS. says  Very like a whale.

HAMLET. says  Then will I come to my mother by and by.—They fool me to the

POLONIUS. says  I will say so.

HAMLET. says  By and by is easily said. Leave me, friends.

ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN. says  We will haste us.

POLONIUS. says  My lord, he’s going to his mother’s closet. Behind the arras

KING. says  Thanks, dear my lord.

HAMLET. says  Now might I do it pat, now he is praying. And now I’ll do’t.

KING. says  My words fly up, my thoughts remain below. Words without thoughts

POLONIUS. says  He will come straight. Look you lay home to him, Tell him his

QUEEN. says  I’ll warrant you, Fear me not. Withdraw, I hear him coming.

HAMLET. says  Now, mother, what’s the matter?

QUEEN. says  Hamlet, thou hast thy father much offended.

HAMLET. says  Mother, you have my father much offended.

QUEEN. says  Come, come, you answer with an idle tongue.

HAMLET. says  Go, go, you question with a wicked tongue.

QUEEN. says  Why, how now, Hamlet?

HAMLET. says  What’s the matter now?

QUEEN. says  Have you forgot me?

HAMLET. says  No, by the rood, not so. You are the Queen, your husband’s

QUEEN. says  Nay, then I’ll set those to you that can speak.

HAMLET. says  Come, come, and sit you down, you shall not budge. You go not

QUEEN. says  What wilt thou do? Thou wilt not murder me? Help, help, ho!

POLONIUS. says  [_Behind._] What, ho! help, help, help!

HAMLET. says  How now? A rat? [_Draws._] Dead for a ducat, dead!

POLONIUS. says  [_Behind._] O, I am slain!

QUEEN. says  O me, what hast thou done?

HAMLET. says  Nay, I know not. is it the King?

QUEEN. says  O what a rash and bloody deed is this!

HAMLET. says  A bloody deed. Almost as bad, good mother, As kill a king and

QUEEN. says  As kill a king?

HAMLET. says  Ay, lady, ’twas my word.— [_To Polonius._] Thou wretched, rash,

QUEEN. says  To whom do you speak this?

HAMLET. says  Do you see nothing there?

QUEEN. says  Nothing at all; yet all that is I see.

HAMLET. says  Nor did you nothing hear?

QUEEN. says  No, nothing but ourselves.

HAMLET. says  Why, look you there! look how it steals away! My father, in his

ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN. says  [_Within._] Hamlet! Lord Hamlet!

HAMLET. says  What noise? Who calls on Hamlet? O, here they come.

ROSENCRANTZ. says  What have you done, my lord, with the dead body?

HAMLET. says  Compounded it with dust, whereto ’tis kin.

ROSENCRANTZ. says  Tell us where ’tis, that we may take it thence, And bear

HAMLET. says  Do not believe it.

ROSENCRANTZ. says  Believe what?

HAMLET. says  That I can keep your counsel, and not mine own. Besides, to be

HAMLET. says  Ay, sir; that soaks up the King’s countenance, his rewards, his

ROSENCRANTZ. says  I understand you not, my lord.

HAMLET. says  I am glad of it. A knavish speech sleeps in a foolish ear.

ROSENCRANTZ. says  My lord, you must tell us where the body is and go with us

HAMLET. says  The body is with the King, but the King is not with the body.

GUILDENSTERN. says  A thing, my lord!

HAMLET. says  Of nothing. Bring me to him. Hide fox, and all after.

KING. says  I have sent to seek him and to find the body. How dangerous is it

ROSENCRANTZ. says  Where the dead body is bestow’d, my lord, We cannot get

KING. says  But where is he?

ROSENCRANTZ. says  Without, my lord, guarded, to know your pleasure.

KING. says  Bring him before us.

ROSENCRANTZ. says  Ho, Guildenstern! Bring in my lord.

KING. says  Now, Hamlet, where’s Polonius?

HAMLET. says  At supper.

KING. says  At supper? Where?

HAMLET. says  Not where he eats, but where he is eaten. A certain convocation

KING. says  Alas, alas!

HAMLET. says  A man may fish with the worm that hath eat of a king, and eat

KING. says  What dost thou mean by this?

HAMLET. says  Nothing but to show you how a king may go a progress through

KING. says  Where is Polonius?

HAMLET. says  In heaven. Send thither to see. If your messenger find him not

KING. says  [_To some Attendants._] Go seek him there.

HAMLET. says  He will stay till you come.

KING. says  Hamlet, this deed, for thine especial safety,— Which we do

HAMLET. says  For England?

KING. says  Ay, Hamlet.

HAMLET. says  Good.

KING. says  So is it, if thou knew’st our purposes.

HAMLET. says  I see a cherub that sees them. But, come; for England!

KING. says  Thy loving father, Hamlet.

FORTINBRAS. says  Go softly on.

HAMLET. says  Good sir, whose powers are these?

HAMLET. says  How purpos’d, sir, I pray you?

HAMLET. says  Who commands them, sir?

HAMLET. says  Goes it against the main of Poland, sir, Or for some frontier?

HAMLET. says  Why, then the Polack never will defend it.

HAMLET. says  Two thousand souls and twenty thousand ducats Will not debate

ROSENCRANTZ. says  Will’t please you go, my lord?

HAMLET. says  I’ll be with you straight. Go a little before.

QUEEN. says  I will not speak with her.

QUEEN. says  What would she have?

QUEEN. says  Let her come in.

OPHELIA. says  Where is the beauteous Majesty of Denmark?

QUEEN. says  How now, Ophelia?

OPHELIA. says  [_Sings._] How should I your true love know From another one?

QUEEN. says  Alas, sweet lady, what imports this song?

OPHELIA. says  Say you? Nay, pray you mark. [_Sings._] He is dead and gone,

QUEEN. says  Nay, but Ophelia—

KING. says  Pretty Ophelia!

OPHELIA. says  Indeed la, without an oath, I’ll make an end on’t. [_Sings._]

OPHELIA. says  I hope all will be well. We must be patient. But I cannot

KING. says  The doors are broke.

HAMLET. says  This?

HAMLET. says  Let me see. [_Takes the skull._] Alas, poor Yorick. I knew him,

HORATIO. says  What’s that, my lord?

HAMLET. says  Dost thou think Alexander looked o’ this fashion i’ th’earth?

HORATIO. says  E’en so.

HAMLET. says  And smelt so? Pah!

HORATIO. says  E’en so, my lord.

HAMLET. says  To what base uses we may return, Horatio! Why may not

HORATIO. says  ’Twere to consider too curiously to consider so.

HAMLET. says  No, faith, not a jot. But to follow him thither with modesty

LAERTES. says  What ceremony else?

HAMLET. says  That is Laertes, a very noble youth. Mark.

LAERTES. says  What ceremony else?

PRIEST. says  Her obsequies have been as far enlarg’d As we have warranties.

LAERTES. says  Must there no more be done?

PRIEST. says  No more be done. We should profane the service of the dead To

LAERTES. says  Lay her i’ th’earth, And from her fair and unpolluted flesh

HAMLET. says  What, the fair Ophelia?

QUEEN. says  [_Scattering flowers._] Sweets to the sweet. Farewell. I hop’d

LAERTES. says  O, treble woe Fall ten times treble on that cursed head Whose

HAMLET. says  [_Advancing._] What is he whose grief Bears such an emphasis?

LAERTES. says  [_Grappling with him._] The devil take thy soul!

HAMLET. says  Thou pray’st not well. I prythee take thy fingers from my

KING. says  Pluck them asunder.

QUEEN. says  Hamlet! Hamlet!

HORATIO. says  Good my lord, be quiet.

HAMLET. says  Why, I will fight with him upon this theme Until my eyelids

QUEEN. says  O my son, what theme?

HAMLET. says  I lov’d Ophelia; forty thousand brothers Could not, with all

KING. says  O, he is mad, Laertes.

QUEEN. says  For love of God forbear him!

HAMLET. says  ’Swounds, show me what thou’lt do: Woul’t weep? woul’t fight?

QUEEN. says  This is mere madness: And thus awhile the fit will work on him;

HAMLET. says  Hear you, sir; What is the reason that you use me thus? I lov’d

KING. says  I pray thee, good Horatio, wait upon him.

HAMLET. says  So much for this, sir. Now let me see the other; You do

HORATIO. says  Remember it, my lord!

HAMLET. says  Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting That would not

HORATIO. says  That is most certain.

HAMLET. says  Up from my cabin, My sea-gown scarf’d about me, in the dark

HORATIO. says  Is’t possible?

HAMLET. says  Here’s the commission, read it at more leisure. But wilt thou

HORATIO. says  I beseech you.

HAMLET. says  Being thus benetted round with villanies,— Or I could make a

HORATIO. says  Ay, good my lord.

HAMLET. says  An earnest conjuration from the King, As England was his

HORATIO. says  How was this seal’d?

HAMLET. says  Why, even in that was heaven ordinant. I had my father’s signet

HORATIO. says  So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to’t.

HAMLET. says  Why, man, they did make love to this employment. They are not

HORATIO. says  Why, what a king is this!

HAMLET. says  Does it not, thinks’t thee, stand me now upon,— He that hath

HORATIO. says  It must be shortly known to him from England What is the issue

HAMLET. says  It will be short. The interim is mine; And a man’s life’s no

HORATIO. says  Peace, who comes here?

OSRIC. says  Your lordship is right welcome back to Denmark.

HAMLET. says  I humbly thank you, sir. Dost know this waterfly?

HORATIO. says  No, my good lord.

HAMLET. says  Thy state is the more gracious; for ’tis a vice to know him. He

OSRIC. says  Sweet lord, if your lordship were at leisure, I should impart a

HAMLET. says  I will receive it with all diligence of spirit. Put your bonnet

OSRIC. says  I thank your lordship, ’tis very hot.

HAMLET. says  No, believe me, ’tis very cold, the wind is northerly.

OSRIC. says  It is indifferent cold, my lord, indeed.

HAMLET. says  Methinks it is very sultry and hot for my complexion.

OSRIC. says  Exceedingly, my lord; it is very sultry,—as ’twere—I cannot tell

HAMLET. says  I beseech you, remember,—

OSRIC. says  Nay, in good faith; for mine ease, in good faith. Sir, here is

HAMLET. says  Sir, his definement suffers no perdition in you, though I know,

OSRIC. says  Your lordship speaks most infallibly of him.

HAMLET. says  The concernancy, sir? Why do we wrap the gentleman in our more

OSRIC. says  Sir?

HORATIO. says  Is’t not possible to understand in another tongue? You will

HAMLET. says  What imports the nomination of this gentleman?

OSRIC. says  Of Laertes?

HORATIO. says  His purse is empty already, all’s golden words are spent.

HAMLET. says  Of him, sir.

OSRIC. says  I know you are not ignorant,—

HAMLET. says  I would you did, sir; yet in faith if you did, it would not

OSRIC. says  You are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is,—

HAMLET. says  I dare not confess that, lest I should compare with him in

OSRIC. says  I mean, sir, for his weapon; but in the imputation laid on him,

HAMLET. says  What’s his weapon?

OSRIC. says  Rapier and dagger.

HAMLET. says  That’s two of his weapons. But well.

OSRIC. says  The King, sir, hath wager’d with him six Barbary horses, against

HAMLET. says  What call you the carriages?

HORATIO. says  I knew you must be edified by the margin ere you had done.

OSRIC. says  The carriages, sir, are the hangers.

HAMLET. says  The phrase would be more german to the matter if we could carry

OSRIC. says  The King, sir, hath laid that in a dozen passes between you and

HAMLET. says  How if I answer no?

OSRIC. says  I mean, my lord, the opposition of your person in trial.

HAMLET. says  Sir, I will walk here in the hall. If it please his Majesty, it

OSRIC. says  Shall I re-deliver you e’en so?

HAMLET. says  To this effect, sir; after what flourish your nature will.

OSRIC. says  I commend my duty to your lordship.

HAMLET. says  Yours, yours.

HORATIO. says  This lapwing runs away with the shell on his head.

HAMLET. says  He did comply with his dug before he suck’d it. Thus has

HAMLET. says  I am constant to my purposes, they follow the King’s pleasure.

HAMLET. says  In happy time.

HAMLET. says  She well instructs me.

HORATIO. says  You will lose this wager, my lord.

HAMLET. says  I do not think so. Since he went into France, I have been in

HORATIO. says  Nay, good my lord.

HAMLET. says  It is but foolery; but it is such a kind of gain-giving as

HORATIO. says  If your mind dislike anything, obey it. I will forestall their

HAMLET. says  Not a whit, we defy augury. There’s a special providence in the

KING. says  Come, Hamlet, come, and take this hand from me.

HAMLET. says  Give me your pardon, sir. I have done you wrong; But pardon’t

LAERTES. says  I am satisfied in nature, Whose motive in this case should

HAMLET. says  I embrace it freely, And will this brother’s wager frankly

LAERTES. says  Come, one for me.

HAMLET. says  I’ll be your foil, Laertes; in mine ignorance Your skill shall

LAERTES. says  You mock me, sir.

HAMLET. says  No, by this hand.

KING. says  Give them the foils, young Osric. Cousin Hamlet, You know the

HAMLET. says  Very well, my lord. Your Grace has laid the odds o’ the weaker

KING. says  I do not fear it. I have seen you both; But since he is better’d,

LAERTES. says  This is too heavy. Let me see another.

HAMLET. says  This likes me well. These foils have all a length?

OSRIC. says  Ay, my good lord.

KING. says  Set me the stoups of wine upon that table. If Hamlet give the

HAMLET. says  Come on, sir.

LAERTES. says  Come, my lord.

HAMLET. says  One.

LAERTES. says  No.

HAMLET. says  Judgment.

OSRIC. says  A hit, a very palpable hit.

LAERTES. says  Well; again.

KING. says  Stay, give me drink. Hamlet, this pearl is thine; Here’s to thy

HAMLET. says  I’ll play this bout first; set it by awhile.

LAERTES. says  A touch, a touch, I do confess.

KING. says  Our son shall win.

QUEEN. says  He’s fat, and scant of breath. Here, Hamlet, take my napkin, rub

HAMLET. says  Good madam.

KING. says  Gertrude, do not drink.

QUEEN. says  I will, my lord; I pray you pardon me.

KING. says  [_Aside._] It is the poison’d cup; it is too late.

HAMLET. says  I dare not drink yet, madam. By and by.

QUEEN. says  Come, let me wipe thy face.

LAERTES. says  My lord, I’ll hit him now.

KING. says  I do not think’t.

LAERTES. says  [_Aside._] And yet ’tis almost ’gainst my conscience.

HAMLET. says  Come for the third, Laertes. You do but dally. I pray you pass

LAERTES. says  Say you so? Come on.

OSRIC. says  Nothing neither way.

LAERTES. says  Have at you now.

KING. says  Part them; they are incens’d.

HAMLET. says  Nay, come again!

OSRIC. says  Look to the Queen there, ho!

HORATIO. says  They bleed on both sides. How is it, my lord?

OSRIC. says  How is’t, Laertes?

LAERTES. says  Why, as a woodcock to my own springe, Osric. I am justly

HAMLET. says  How does the Queen?

KING. says  She swoons to see them bleed.

QUEEN. says  No, no, the drink, the drink! O my dear Hamlet! The drink, the

HAMLET. says  O villany! Ho! Let the door be lock’d: Treachery! Seek it out.

LAERTES. says  It is here, Hamlet. Hamlet, thou art slain. No medicine in the

HAMLET. says  The point envenom’d too! Then, venom, to thy work.

OSRIC and LORDS. says  Treason! treason!

KING. says  O yet defend me, friends. I am but hurt.

HAMLET. says  Here, thou incestuous, murderous, damned Dane, Drink off this

LAERTES. says  He is justly serv’d. It is a poison temper’d by himself.

HAMLET. says  Heaven make thee free of it! I follow thee. I am dead, Horatio.

HORATIO. says  Never believe it. I am more an antique Roman than a Dane.

HAMLET. says  As th’art a man, Give me the cup. Let go; by Heaven, I’ll

HAMLET. says  O, I die, Horatio. The potent poison quite o’er-crows my

FORTINBRAS. says  Where is this sight?

HORATIO. says  What is it you would see? If aught of woe or wonder, cease

FORTINBRAS. says  This quarry cries on havoc. O proud death, What feast is

HORATIO. says  Not from his mouth, Had it th’ability of life to thank you. He

FORTINBRAS. says  Let us haste to hear it, And call the noblest to the
